Things to remember while working with R Studio:

- If R is restarted then you should reload the necessary packages using "require"
- Check on the package pane that the package you intend to use the check box is checked.
- If you have been using few packages and half way through you restart R the packges previously loaded will no longer be loaded, so be mindful while working on command line - use require to load the necessary packages prior to invoking the commands.
