Things to remember while working with R Studio:

- If R is restarted then you should reload the necessary packages using "require"
- Check on the package pane that the package you intend to use the check box is checked.
- If you have been using few packages and half way through you restart R the packges previously loaded will no longer be loaded, so be mindful while working on command line - use require to load the necessary packages prior to invoking the commands.

- R the vector first index is 1 and not 0

- In R everything is a vector. Even if the number is a vector with element length of 1 which is the numeric value assigned to the variable.

- Create Vector c(1, NA, 3, 4) - length = 4

- NA - Missing Data

- NULL - absence of data c(1, NULL, 3, 4) - length = 3

-- Data frames can store in each column different types of data types.
